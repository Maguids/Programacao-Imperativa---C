# Imperative Programming -> C

---

This repository aims to expose **my resolutions of the exercises proposed by the subject 'Imperative Programming'**, as well as **its statements**.
These exercises were made available to me through Moodle.
Each folder corresponds to a worksheet, in which the statements and my respective resolutions that were accepted by Codex are available.
